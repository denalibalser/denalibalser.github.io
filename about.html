<p>I am a (relatively) recent graduate of the University of Vermont where I earned my bachelors degree in Environmental Studies with a concentration in Environmental Policy and Development. I have begun this software engineering journey at the Flatiron School with the goal of gaining a powerful skill set with which to influence the future of sustainability and environmentalism. I was drawn to software engineering due to its expanding influence worldwide and its subsequent ability to reach a huge, international audience, which is exactly the scope that is needed given our environmental reality. </p>
